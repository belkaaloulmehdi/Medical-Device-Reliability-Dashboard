# Medical Device Reliability & Maintenance Analysis  
*Power BI Dashboard*

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes medical device performance by examining failure events, downtime, maintenance frequency, and and cost across multiple equipment types and manufacturers.  
The objective is to build a three-page Power BI dashboard that provides operational visibility, supports engineering decisions, and identifies high-risk devices requiring prioritization.

This dashboard was created as part of a real-world portfolio exercise to demonstrate practical BI skills relevant to engineering, healthcare, and maintenance analytics.

## Dataset & Context

The dataset contains anonymized information about medical devices, including:

- Device type, model, and manufacturer  
- Failure event counts  
- Downtime (hours)  
- Maintenance frequency and cost  
- Maintenance class (criticality level)  
- Country and purchase date  

This dataset enables realistic analysis of equipment reliability and operational cost structures.
